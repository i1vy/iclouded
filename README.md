# iclouded


## installation
i recommend using venv for this so
```bash
python -m venv venv
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## configuration
heres the config remember to change the username and password xD
```toml
[user]
username = ""
password = ""

[options]
location = "~/icloud"
```
^ put this in `iclouded.toml` in the same folder as all the python files


## running
im lazy so you have to just run it with `./venv/bin/python main.py`
